# ðŸ¤– Modeling Notes

This document contains ideas, experiments, and decisions related to the machine learning models used in the F1â€‘ML project.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Definition

- What do we want to predict? (e.g., lap time, pit strategy, driver performanceâ€¦)
- What is the expected output (regression? classification?)

## ðŸ§  ML Algorithms to Explore

- [ ] Linear Regression
- [ ] Random Forest
- [ ] XGBoost
- [ ] Neural Network (optional)

## ðŸ“Š Feature Ideas

- Tyre compound
- Track temperature
- Driver
- Team
- Position on grid
- Time since last pit stop

## âœ… Baseline

- Simple model to beat (e.g. median lap time by compound)
- Evaluation metric: RMSE / MAE / RÂ²
